Ionic cordova App creation steps.
1. download ionic and cordova, follow the steps given on the site
2. start your project and do stuff
to release .apk file (ofcourse you will need android sdk, the best way is to install android studio and run it. It helps load all the dependecies you for android sdk)
1. run : ionic cordova run android --prod --release
once finished 
2. if you have my-release-key.keystore then
from folder where my-release-key.keystore
run : jarsigner -verbose -sigalg SHA1withRSA -digestalg SHA1 -keystore my-release-key.keystore <path of unsigned .apk file with .apk file name> alias_name
3. if not
run : keytool -genkey -v -keystore my-release-key.keystore -alias alias_name -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
this will generate a file, do not loose that file ever (if you want to continue updating your app);
go to step 2
4. go to android_sdk\build-tools\<version number>
run : zipalign -v 4 <path of unsigned .apk file with .apk file name> <path of where you will generate new apk file and file name with .pk extention>
